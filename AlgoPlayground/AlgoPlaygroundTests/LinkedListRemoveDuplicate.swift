    ** Prompt **
 
    You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values.
    Write a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values.
 
    The linked list should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand new Linked List), and the modified should still have its
    nodes sorted with respect to their values.
 
    Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or `non/nil` if it's the tail
    of the list.
