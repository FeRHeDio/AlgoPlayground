    The Fibonacci Sequence is defined as follos: The first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)nth numbers.
    
    Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the Nth Fibonacci number.
 
    Important Note: The Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
    For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, and so on.
