## _Algorithms and Data Structures in Swift, complete with test coverage._

As a way of practicing Algorithms and Datastructures using Swift I'll be populating this repo daily.

### Current problems: `17`.. _and counting_

#### Strings
- Palindrome Checker
- Caesar Cipher Encryptor - tdd-ish

#### Binary Trees
- Node Depths
- Branch Sums
- Evaluate Expression

#### Graphs
- Depth First Search

#### Greedy Algorithms
- Tandem Bicycle
- Optimal Freelancing
- Class Photo
- Minimum Waiting Time

#### Searching
- Binary Search

#### Sorting
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort

#### Linked Lists
- Remove Duplicates

#### Recursion
- Product Sum
- Fibonacci Sequence

#### Arrays
- Two Number Sum

## Features
Every problem includes:

- A Prompt for the problem to solve at the top of each `test file`
- The implementation of the solution.
- `Big O notation` - Complexity Analysis for each problem
- Set of basic tests to verify the validity of the implementation. Aways in green state.

## Installation

- Clone the repo.
- Hit `CMD+U` to run the tests and see them pass.

## Requirements

- Just Xcode and the willingness to learn DSA

## Collaboration

- If you want to collaborate just open a PR a leave a nice description.
- If you want to reach out feel free to do so.
