## _Algorithms and Data Structures in Swift, complete with test coverage._

As a way of practicing Algorithms and Datastructures using Swift I'll be populating this repo daily.

### Current problems 15 _and counting_: _history

#### Strings

#### Arrays
- Two Number Sum

## Features
Every problem includes:

- A Prompt for the problem to solve at the top of each `test file`
- The implementation of the solution.
- `Big O notation` - Complexity Analysis for each problem

## Installation

- Clone the repo.
- Hit `CMD+U` to run the tests and see them pass.

## Requirements

- Just Xcode and the willingness to learn DSA

## Collaboration

- If you want to collaborate just open a PR a leave a nice description.
